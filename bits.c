/*
 * INTEGER CODING RULES
 * Functions are constructed out of integers and expressions. All variables must
 * be declared at the tops of functions.
 *
 * Expressions must use ONLY the following:
 *  1.  Integer constants from 0 through 255 (0xFF), inclusively
 *  2.  Function arguments and local variables (No globals allowed)
 *  3.  Unary integer operations ! ~
 *  4.  Binary integer operations & ^ | + << >>
 *
 * You are expressly forbidden to:
 *  1.  Use any control constructs such as if, do, while, for, switch
 *  2.  Define or use any macros
 *  3.  Define any additional functions in the file
 *  4.  Call any functions
 *  5.  Use any other operations, such as && || - ?:
 *  6.  Use any form of casting
 *  7.  Use any data type other than int (no structs/arrays/unions)
 *
 * You may assume that your machine:
 *  1.  Uses 2s complement, 32-bit representations of integers
 *  2.  Performs right shifts arithmetically
 *  3.  Has unpredictable behavior when shifting if shamt < 0 or shamt > 31
 */

/*
 * FLOATING POINT CODING RULES
 * For floating-point problems, you are allowed to use looping or conditions.
 * You may also allowed to use both int and unsigned types.
 * You may also use arbitrary int and unsigned constants of any size.
 * Finally, you may use any arithmetic, logical, or comparison operations.
 *
 * You are expressly forbidden to:
 *  1.  Define or use any macros
 *  2.  Define any additional functions in the file
 *  3.  Call any functions
 *  4.  Use any form of casting
 *  5.  Use any data type other than int or unsigned (no structs/arrays/unions)
 *  6.  Use any floating-point data types, operations, or constants
